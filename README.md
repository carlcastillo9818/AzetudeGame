# AzetudeGame
 A clone of the popular Pong game made with the Phaser game framework made by new indie game dev team called Cranatis.
 The plot is simple: an alien in a UFO stumbles upon an astronaut in space and they decide to duke it out in outer space (pong style) until they can reach the high score (which means the other ship gets destroyed) and the winner can go home afterwards.
